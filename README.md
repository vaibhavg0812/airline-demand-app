# airline-demand-app

I developed a Python Flask web application that enables users to upload a CSV file containing airline booking data. Upon upload, the app processes the data using Pandas, extracts useful insights such as daily passenger trends, top 5 busiest routes, and per-route statistics. It then visualizes this information using Chart.js and displays a summary table for easy analysis. The solution is lightweight, responsive (using Bootstrap), and includes clear setup instructions for local deployment.
